## Introduction

Hi! My name is Sebastian, and I'm Computer Science student (University of Economics in Katowice). 
During my studies, I acquired the knowledge necessary for the profession of a data analyst, and in my spare time, I strengthened my skills by courses and freelancing.

	- Finished [Excel Skills For Business Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/excel)
	- During [Excel Skills for Data Analytics and Visualization Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/excel-data-analytics-visualization)
	
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, seaborn)
	- My bachelor's degree project is an artificial intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm for playing poker
	
- SQL (Join, subqueries, functions, read/update/delete)
	- During studies During my studies, I learned SQL at an intermediate level

## Portfolio Projects
In This section I will present my data analytics projects
### Creating fake dataset using python
**Code:** [Creating_Fake_Dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/maxiorex15625/Portfolio/blob/main/Creating_Fake_Dataset.ipynb)
**Description:** I couldn't find data, that would suit my excel dashboard, so I created mine, fake dataset. 
**Technology:** NumPy and Faker (Python)

### EDA of created fake dataset
**Code:** [Fakedata_EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/maxiorex15625/Portfolio/blob/main/Fakedata_EDA.ipynb)
**Description:** Simple EDA of dataset created in previous step.
**Technology:** Pandas, NumPy, seaborn
	
### Data Analysis and excel dynamic dashboard
**Description:** Data analysis of created fake dataset. I will present some screenshots as it is macro enabled workbook (xlsm)

This is how data table looks.

 Almost every column has data validation (lists) based on "lists" located in tables
